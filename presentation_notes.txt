Potter, M. C., & Fox, L. F. (2009). Detecting and remembering simultaneous pictures 
in a rapid serial visual presentation. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human 
Perception and Performance, 35(1), 28â€“38. https://doi.org/10.1037/a0013624

Research question:
- Interested in visual processing ontology and the differential variables impacting 
target detection and memory.
- Experiment 2: Whether multiple simultaneously presented targets can be consolidated
concurrently as easily as a single target.
- Does the number of targets to remember impact subsequent recognition and how does
presentation time affect this?

Interest:
- Reasoning: Many studies have investigated detection as a proxy for processing 
ability, but memory is equally important.
- Previous studies have demonstrated a disparity between minimum presentation times 
for detection and memory, suggesting different processing paths?

Methods:
- 18 participants (none repeated from previous tasks)
- 75 trials (72 + 3 practice trials)
- Each trial: 8 frame RSVP sequence
    -> 0-4 pictures on each frame
    -> Equal number of pictures in each position on frame across trials
    -> Equal likelihood of pictures in each condition being in each position
    -> Random order of presentation
    -> No pictures on frames 1 and 8
    -> Presentation time: 240, 400 or 720 ms (counterbalanced between and within 
    participants)
- Participants asked to "view and remember" the pictures
- 200 ms after RSVP: yes-no recognition test
    -> 4 pictures from RSVP, 4 new pictures
    -> Counterbalanced across trials
    -> Pictures presented one at a time, centred, for 400 ms
    -> After presentation: blank screen until participant response
    -> No feedback given

Implementation plan:

Problems:
- > 176 million derangements with 12 stimuli -> not feasible
